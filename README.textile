"Linear Feedback Shift Register":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFSR

Wkipedia describes LFSRs as:

bq. A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.

There is an interesting class of LFSRs that have maximal length, the article calls these "m-sequences":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence.  The interesting property is that for a given width, they produce all possible combinations, once and only once.  This means they will enumerate all the possible values, but not in an easily identifiable sequence.
